    "introduction": "Each of the tasks in this room gives a numeric answer, which will then be used for the final puzzle. The time limit gives approximately 5 minutes per task, but some tasks are easier than others - you may be able to escape without completing all of the tasks if you can still solve the final puzzle. All the information you should need is on this page, either in the task description itself or in the reference sheets for the task.",

Morse code - for those who haven't seen it before - is a method of encoding text into a series of dots and dashes, which can then be used to communicate by any means of sight or sound - for example, by flashing a light or making a loud noise - and the use of sight/sound means that messages can be communicated over a long distance. In addition to dots and dashes, a forward slash can sometimes be used to split up characters. The text in this task contains a number, given in Morse code. You must find the Morse code and then convert it to get the answer. The reference sheet should help with decyphering.",

A ROT13 cypher is its own inverse - shifting the letter N using ROT13 would return the letter A again. Shift the word below to find the answer.\n\nGJRAGLBAR",
